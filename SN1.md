The SN1 reaction, or unimolecular nucleophilic substitution, is a two-step reaction mechanism. It begins with the formation of a carbocation intermediate when the leaving group departs from the substrate. This step is slow and determines the reaction rate, which is why it's called unimolecular. The nucleophile then quickly attacks the carbocation, leading to the formation of the final product. SN1 reactions typically occur in polar protic solvents and favor substrates that can stabilize the carbocation, such as tertiary alkyl halides.
