Polar solvents are solvents with molecules that have a significant dipole moment, meaning they have a partial positive charge on one end and a partial negative charge on the other. This polarity allows them to dissolve ionic compounds and other polar substances effectively.

Examples include water, methanol, and acetone.

Polar solvents are two types:

- [[Polar Protic]]
- [[Polar Aportic]]
