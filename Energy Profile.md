The energy profile of an \( \text{S}_\text{N}2 \) (bimolecular nucleophilic substitution) reaction features a single-step mechanism with a transition state. Here's a brief outline:

1. **Reactants**: A nucleophile (Nu⁻) and a substrate with a leaving group (R-LG) start at a certain energy level.
2. **Transition State**: The nucleophile attacks the carbon atom from the opposite side of the leaving group, forming a high-energy, unstable transition state where the carbon is partially bonded to both the nucleophile and the leaving group. This is the highest point on the energy profile.
3. **Products**: The leaving group (LG⁻) departs, and the nucleophile is fully bonded to the carbon (R-Nu), resulting in a lower energy level than the transition state.
