- if C - x is ionic charcher then initimate ion pair generate -> $R^+$  || $X^-$ -> Generally #SN1


- if C -X is colvalent charcter then -> $R^{\delta + }$ ------ $X^{\delta -}$  -> generally #SN2

#### Transition State

![[2.png]]


Its hybridization is $sp^2$ 

#### Rate

it is 2nd order. 
Rate depend on both substrate and Nu


- No of Intermediate = No of TS - 1

In SN2 there is no Intermediate.
