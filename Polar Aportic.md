Polar aprotic solvents are polar solvents that lack hydrogen atoms directly bonded to electronegative atoms, so they cannot donate hydrogen bonds. However, they can still dissolve many ionic and polar substances due to their high dielectric constants. 

Examples include acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and acetonitrile.
