==For making reaction,   we need to make substrate into a  good leaving group== 


#### Ways to make good leaving group into Alcohols

1.  Reaction with acids
	 -  Mineral Acids
	 - Organic Acids
	 -  Lewis Acids

  2. Group  Additon 
	    -  TsCl  / MSCl / TfCl /  base (Pyridine or $Et_3N$ )
3. Group having vacant d-orbital
		- PCl5, PCl3 , PBr3 , SR2,
