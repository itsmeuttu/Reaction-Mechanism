The Mitsunobu Reaction allows the conversion of primary and secondary alcohols to esters, phenyl ethers, thioethers and various other compounds. The nucleophile employed should be acidic, since one of the reagents (diethylazodicarboxylate) must be protonated during the course of the reaction to prevent from side reactions.
