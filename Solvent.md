Non polar makes TS state unstable 

1. Polar Protic solvent 



![[7.png]]
Polar protic solvent make stable of Nu , so it makes stable and increase the activation energy

So Rate will slow if , we are using Polar protic solvent in SN2.

``
2. Polar Aportic Solvent:
DMSO , DMF , Acetone

so , now I- can easily attack 

Na+ is captured by polar aportic solvent.
Only remain -> RO-
which is naked and very unstable so energy is high -> rate will increase

so we use polar Aportic solvent in SN2
