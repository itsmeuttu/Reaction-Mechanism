A solvent that can facilitate the formation of the carbocation intermediate will speed up the rate-determining step of the SN1 reaction.
The preferred solvents for this type of reaction are both polar and protic.
The polar nature of the solvent helps to stabilize ionic intermediates whereas the protic nature of the solvent helps solvate the leaving group.
Examples of solvents used in SN1 reactions include water and alcohol. These solvents also act as nucleophiles.



We need Polar Protic solvent.
